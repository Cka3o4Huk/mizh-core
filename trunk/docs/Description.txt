The primary goal is researching the fast and modular OS kernel.
Main problems planning to solve is minimization count of syscalls
and content switching. Also it will be realize flexible model 
of independent layers of kernels.

Initial layers is hardware, core, platform and application. 
This all must be provide flexible access to different features 
and functions of microkernel.
